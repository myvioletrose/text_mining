The real problem (or edge) isn't with the product, but with the client themselves.  Clients seek annuities to protect downside when they cannot stomach the volatility that is required to achieve the returns they need to sustain their bloated lifestyle relative to their resources.  Instead of addressing these fundamental problems, the clients are caught up in the marketing hype of magic bullet solutions that can get them all the upside with none of the downside.  If the asset managers, and their marketing departments, could begin focusing on the real underlying problems and how their products can be a part of the solution instead of how they're 0.07% better than their competitor, then they'd get a flood of new business.
